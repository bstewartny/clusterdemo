add "more like this" link - show all MLT results (and compute similarity)
enable clustering on/off buttons
run feeds + clustering on some schedule
make clustering work incrementally (only fetch unclustered new docs)
add paging controls
remove "topics"/"sources" buttons on nav bar
better way to visualize clusters
  show word cloud per cluster?
  show thumbnail per cluster?
  show dendrogram / hierarchical clusters?
document to describe architecture and show architecture diagram...
!!! make feeds work incrementally - dont re-index if already exists...
